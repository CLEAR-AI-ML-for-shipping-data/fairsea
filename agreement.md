#### Collaboration agreement for research projects

Terms of agreement for collaborating with Digital Research Engineers at e-commons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We share programming code and results with the understanding that:

1. It will be used for non-commercial research purposes only, unless agreed upon in a separate agreement.
2. It won't be made publicly available without formally seeking everyone's consent.
3. If one uses it for some scientific article/report, or similar, we will be part of the authors/contributors list and formally included in the process of writing and presenting the results. Resulting publications follow the Chalmers Open Access policy (<https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/organisation-and-governance/how-chalmers-is-steered/general-policy-documents/open-access-policy/>).
4. A data management plan will be developed and updated.

Complying with the above authorizes you to use, copy, modify, and publish project code and results.
